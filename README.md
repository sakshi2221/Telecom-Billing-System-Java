# Telecom Billing & Call Data Analysis System



**Tech Stack:** Java, JSP, JDBC, MySQL, HTML/CSS

## Project Description
This project acts as a bridge between Telecommunication signal data and user billing. It processes Call Data Records (CDRs) to generate accurate bills for customers based on their usage (Data/Voice).

## Key Modules
1. **Signal Processor (Backend):** Parses raw call data files and updates the central SQL database.
2. **Web Portal (Frontend):** Allows customers to view usage, pay bills, and log complaints.
3. **Admin Dashboard:** Manages plans, generates reports, and monitors network usage stats.

## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT sensors for real-time data monitoring.
- AI-based fraud detection for billing anomalies.
